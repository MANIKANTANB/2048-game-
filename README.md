# 2048-game-
2048 is a single-player puzzle game where the player slides tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is written by me  in python and uses the library pygame for its GUI. The game logic is separated from the display logic to make it  easy to understand.
